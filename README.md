This is a chess game written in Python and has a nice, clean graphical user interface. Unlike the many codes you can find on GitHub and the Internet, this code is complete.
This codebase uses four separate modules, each with its own responsibilities. One of these modules is the status module, whose job is to estimate the “state number” for every position. This module essentially exposes two functions: one that computes the state number for a given position by evaluating all possible moves. Specifically, it can calculate and report exactly how many legal moves each player has in a given position, and the status number is defined as the white’s total number of moves minus the black’s total number of moves. Unlike other files in the project or other projects on GitHub and YouTube, this project is complete and includes significant features such as checkmate detection, check detection, castling rights, and other move types. You can also extend this project in the future with additional features, such as configuring the sound for each piece’s move or the sound when a piece is captured by another piece. The project aims to be comprehensive. If you notice any gaps or bugs, please reply and let us know.
